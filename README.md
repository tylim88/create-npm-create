Welcome to packageception ðŸ˜ˆ

to put it simple: this is a package that allow you to create something like create-react-app, but much simpler and easier to use.

It is very easy to use, simply put the project you want to bootstrap into the template folder, you can study this example [Create Prisma App](https://github.com/tylim88/create-prisma-app)

after you are done with your package name and description, simply npm publish.

What it does:
-copy everything in template directory when your user run create-example-app <project-name>
-automatically install the dependency for your user.
