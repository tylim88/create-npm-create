Welcome to packageception ðŸ˜ˆ

simply put this is a package that allow you to create something like create-react-app, but is much simpler and easier to use.

For example if you have project A and you want to create a project generator for project A

It is very easy to use, after installation, just follow the steps:

1. rename project A .gitignore to toBeRenamed
2. copy everything in project A (except node_modules and etc etc) into the template folder

you can study this example [Create Prisma App](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-prisma-app) and [Create Next Apollo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-apollo)

finally it looks like this

after you are done with your package name and description, simply npm publish.

What it does:  
-copy everything in template directory when your user run create-example-app project-name  
-automatically install the dependency for your user.
