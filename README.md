to put it simple: this is a package that allow you to create something like create-react-app, but much simpler and easier to use.

It is very easy to use, simply copy the content of project you want to bootstrap into the template folder, you can study this example [Create Prisma App](https://github.com/tylim88/create-prisma-app)

-copy everything in template directory when your user run create-example-app <project-name>  
-automatically install the dependency for your user.
